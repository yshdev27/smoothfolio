# winter arc 🥶

## This is what I’ve planned to achieve in the next approx 4 months

# Goals

- Run a half marathon
- Build a personal brand on LinkedIn/Instagram
- Gain 10-12lbs muscle
- Reading top 3 philosophy books

## Running a half marathon

I am really aiming for sky high here, but I think I can do it. Not really a runner but I think I have enough legs for it. Its around 21 kms and that’s 4-5 times of what my actual strength atm is. This will need a lot of concentration on endurance training which I rarely do. A full marathon would have been the ideal target but for realistic purpose, I would want to keep it chill this time. Not pushing heart out of my chest and still getting a medal, that would be nice (at least for my mom). At last a use of these long legs for once.

## Building a personal brand

With the competition and absolute menace in the market, there’s no choice but to build a personal brand now. I recently saw that LinkedIn was pushing new creators with genuine content more and more where text and image content is working same as video. Can’t say that about Instagram where video and hook is king. Till I find some simple editing plan, I am getting 15-25k audience on LinkedIn which is worth a lot in any case. Consistent content twice a day would be enough and I hope everything else takes its due course.

## Gaining muscle back

I’m teary eyed when I talk about this now, I lost significant gains in last few months which I’m really sad for. Its really tough to get those 3500 kcal in daily and not everyone would understand for obvious reasons. Strength is absolutely there but a bit of power and explosiveness would not hurt. If I’m on my song, this is the realistic progression I would be expecting:

- Pullups - from 18/20 to 30
- DB Press - 20kgs to 30-35kgs
- Squats - 70kgs to 100/110 kgs
- DB Sh Press - 17.5kgs to 25kgs
- Obv start training abductors and adductors

## Reading top 3 philosophy

A lot of people talk about **Nietzsche** and **Dostoevsky** but I think work from **Immanuel Kant** and **David Hume** is much resonating and easy to boil down for me. But I still want to give one shot to every one of them. I’ve heard from friends that the older philosophy is kinda hard to get grasp of but who cares, I’ve done my fair share of suffering with Nassim Nicholas Taleb, I’ll be alright (at least I hope so). My expectations are too high and I hope to get the warmth I’m looking for from them.
