# reflection on 27th

I turned 27 today, and had a list of thoughts and wanted to pen it down. Now, I know this could easily be written in a journal but who’s reading this anyway. Even if someone is, welcome along.

So, it's that part of my life where everything is moving at 2x speed and before I catch a blink, things pass by. Actually, what I really think happened is I did not have enough time and energy to take a pause and reflect back on everything, making me lose the anchor point all along.

I had a lot of important targets for this year, few of them achieved, majority of them I did not. This is where I think I want to improve and be more clinical in the upcoming year. I’ve had so many thoughts, so many things going on, making me not concentrate on a very few important ones.

Enough whining but there are a lot of things I am grateful for, starting from health and peace point of view. I am alive, my family is healthy and that’s **#1** thing for me. I’ve been more health conscious this year (not that I wasn’t before), but the health targets were not optimal and had to work on them.

Overall, I am happy where things are, not that I’ve made a great progress but at least I’ve another chance to make that progress again. I wish for more contentment and gratefulness in the life. Its a bit nervy to getting old but I’m sure life is happening for me and will embrace me with open arms.
